# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Map Step-by-Step Guide

Importance and Usefulness of Threat Maps:
1. Ehanced Situational Awareness: Mapping threats to your IT environment allowing you to view potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.<BR>
2. Integration with MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Microsoft Sentinel integrates with the MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework, allowing you to map detected threats and analytics rules.<BR>
3. Proactive Threat Hunting: Threat maps support proactive threat hunting by enabling analysts to visualize and explore relationships between different threat indicators and activities.<BR>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Conclusion: Threat Maps in Microsoft Sentinel are vital for visualizing and understanding the complex landscape of cyber threats within your organization. They enhance situational awareness, integrate with established frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ, and support proactive threat hunting. By leveraging workbooks, custom mapping, and _"Structured Threat Information Expression"_ (STIX) objects, you can create comprehensive threat maps that inform and strengthen your security posture.
