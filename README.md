### A deep dive into creating Threat Maps, they're importance and usefulness.

# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Map Step-by-Step Guide

Importance and Usefulness of Threat Maps:
1. Ehanced Situational Awareness: Mapping threats to your IT environment allowing you to view potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.<BR>
2. Integration with MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Microsoft Sentinel integrates with the MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework, allowing you to map detected threats and analytics rules.<BR>
3. Proactive Threat Hunting: Threat maps support proactive threat hunting by enabling analysts to visualize and explore relationships between different threat indicators and activities.<BR>
